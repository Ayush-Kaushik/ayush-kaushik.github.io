This website is designed to be easy to navigate and provides an overview of my `skills`, `experience` and `projects`. It also includes my `resume` and `contact` information, making it easy for potential employers and clients to get in touch with me.

It also integrates with my `GitHub`, `LinkedIn` and `Dev.To` profiles to provide you a better understanding of my skills and experience.
